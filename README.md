Alamo Region Housing Affordability Analysis
Overview
This project analyzes the affordability of single-family homes in the Alamo region, focusing on the required hourly wage needed to afford a home both with and without the inclusion of property taxes. The analysis compares data from July 2023 and July 2024 to provide a year-over-year perspective on housing costs and income requirements.

Data Sources
All data used in this analysis comes from public sources, including:

San Antonio Board of REALTORSÂ® (SABOR): Provides detailed data on average home prices and property characteristics in the Alamo region.
Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS): Supplies wage and employment data for the region, used to calculate the required income levels.
Methodology
Mortgage Calculation
For both July 2023 and July 2024, the average price of single-family homes was used to calculate the mortgage payment. The following parameters were applied:

Mortgage Rate: 5% annual rate
Loan Term: 30 years (360 months)
Down Payment: 20% of the home price
Property Tax Rate: 2% (adjusted from the regional average of 2.5%)
Required Income and Hourly Wage
The analysis calculated the annual income required to afford the mortgage payments, assuming that housing costs should not exceed 30% of gross income. This required income was then converted into an hourly wage, assuming a 40-hour workweek and 52 weeks of work per year.

Why a 2% Property Tax Rate Was Used
The average property tax rate for the Alamo region is approximately 2.5%. However, this analysis uses a 2% rate due to the influence of Bexar County. Bexar County, which includes San Antonio, has a higher property tax rate and a higher volume of home sales compared to other areas in the region. This combination tends to raise the overall average property tax rate for the region. By using a 2% rate, we aim to provide a more generalized and potentially more applicable estimate for a broader audience, especially those outside of Bexar County. This approach allows us to present a more balanced and conservative view of the income required to afford a home in the Alamo region.

Results
The results of the analysis are presented in a bar chart, comparing the average home prices and the required hourly wage to afford a home in July 2023 and July 2024. The chart includes:

Average Home Price: The average price of single-family homes in July 2023 and July 2024.
Hourly Wage (No Taxes): The hourly wage required to afford a home without including property taxes.
Hourly Wage (With Taxes): The hourly wage required to afford a home including property taxes.
The chart highlights the significant impact of property taxes on the required income, demonstrating how even a modest property tax rate can substantially increase the income needed to afford a home in the Alamo region.

Usage
The Python code provided in this repository can be used to replicate the analysis with updated data or to adjust the parameters (e.g., mortgage rate, property tax rate) to see how they affect the required income and hourly wage. The code is designed to be flexible and easily adaptable to different datasets or regions.

Exclusions
Multi-Family Homes: This analysis is restricted to single-family homes and does not include multi-family properties.
Rural/Ranch Properties: Properties classified as rural or ranch were also excluded to focus solely on residential homes within urban and suburban settings.
Visualization

Conclusion
This analysis provides a clear picture of the financial challenges faced by prospective homebuyers in the Alamo region, particularly when considering the impact of property taxes. By using a conservative 2% property tax rate, the analysis offers a balanced perspective that can be useful for policymakers, real estate professionals, and potential buyers.
