Data Sources and Methodology
All data used in this analysis was obtained from publicly available sources, specifically from Realtor Associations and the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS). The housing data, including average home prices, was sourced from Realtor Associations, which provide comprehensive and up-to-date information on real estate market trends. This data is critical for understanding the financial requirements for homeownership in specific regions.

The wage and employment data were sourced from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS), a reliable and authoritative source for labor market information in the United States. The BLS data was used to estimate the necessary income and hourly wages required to afford a home in the Alamo region, factoring in both mortgage payments and property taxes.

Impact of Property Taxes on Required Income for Homeownership
The inclusion of property taxes in the calculation of required income for homeownership significantly increases the necessary income due to the cumulative effect of mortgage payments and property tax payments. Property taxes are typically paid annually and can amount to a substantial sum, especially in areas with higher property tax rates.

In this analysis, a property tax rate of 2% was used instead of the average rate. This choice was made to account for the specific economic conditions in the Alamo region, particularly Bexar County, where property tax rates tend to be higher than the regional average. By using a 2% rate, the calculation reflects a more realistic scenario for many residents in this area, ensuring that the results are both relevant and accurate for local conditions.

The substantial increase in the required hourly wage when property taxes are included is due to the fact that property taxes add an additional fixed annual cost to homeownership. This cost must be covered by the homeowner's income, and when property taxes are high, the required income increases accordingly. As a result, the hourly wage necessary to afford a home, including property taxes, rises sharply compared to calculations that exclude these taxes.
